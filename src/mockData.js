      1. The germination stage alone takes 7 to 10 days.
      2. After germination the first male flower would be seen within 35 to 55 days roughly, which will be later followed by developing a female flower in one or two weeks (i.e., 42 to 62 days).
      3. The fertilized female flower will take 10 to 12 days to produce fruits.`,

     `Kale is a cultivar of the species Brassica oleracea. It has green or purple leaves that
      branch off from one to multiple upright stems and do not form a head like cabbage. The plant is usually
      grown as an annual, but if grown as a perennial, it will form seeds in the second year. Current popular
      varieties include Curly kale, Italian kale, and Red Russian kale (green leaves with pale purple stems).
      It can be grown as baby salad greens or for bunching adult leaves. Leaves are sweeter after a frost and
      delicious eaten raw, added to salads, saut√©ed, or added to stews and casseroles.`,
